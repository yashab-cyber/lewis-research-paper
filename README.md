## ðŸ“Œ Abstract  
The **Linux Environment Working Intelligence System (LEWIS)** is a next-generation AI-powered cybersecurity assistant designed for Linux-based environments such as **Kali Linux, Termux, and servers**.  
LEWIS integrates **machine learning, natural language processing, and automation** to revolutionize how ethical hackers and cybersecurity analysts:  

- Interact with security tools  
- Automate vulnerability assessment and VAPT audits  
- Generate professional security reports and certificates  
- Detect, respond, and visualize threats in real time  
- Use both **command-line and web-based interfaces**  

This framework bridges the gap between **AI and cybersecurity**, enabling scalable, intelligent security operations.
