# Security Policy

## 🔐 Security Commitment

The LEWIS (Linux Environment Working Intelligence System) project takes security seriously. As a cybersecurity research project, we are committed to maintaining the highest security standards and following responsible disclosure practices.

## 📋 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Active support  |
| 0.9.x   | ⚠️ Limited support |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please use one of the following methods:

### 1. Email Report (Preferred)
- **Email**: [security@yashabalam.me](mailto:security@yashabalam.me)
- **Subject**: "SECURITY: [Brief Description]"
- **PGP Key**: Available on request for sensitive reports

### 2. Private Security Advisory
- Use GitHub's [private security advisory feature](https://github.com/yashab-cyber/lewis-research-paper/security/advisories/new)
- This allows for confidential discussion and coordinated disclosure

### 3. Encrypted Communication
For highly sensitive reports, we can arrange encrypted communication:
- Signal: Available on request
- ProtonMail: Available on request

## 📝 What to Include in Your Report

Please include as much information as possible:

### Required Information
- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., injection, authentication bypass, privilege escalation)
- **Affected Components**: Specific modules, functions, or endpoints
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential consequences of the vulnerability
- **Reproduction Steps**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue

### Additional Helpful Information
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
- **Discovery Context**: How you discovered the vulnerability
- **Research Notes**: Any additional technical details

### Example Report Template
```
Subject: SECURITY: SQL Injection in User Authentication Module

Vulnerability Type: SQL Injection
Affected Component: /src/auth/user_login.py, line 45
CVSS Score: 8.5 (High)

Description:
The user authentication function does not properly sanitize user input, 
allowing for SQL injection attacks that could lead to data exfiltration 
and authentication bypass.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Navigate to login endpoint
2. Enter the following in the username field: admin'; DROP TABLE users; --
3. Observe unauthorized database access

Impact:
- Authentication bypass
- Potential data loss
- Unauthorized access to user accounts

Suggested Remediation:
Implement parameterized queries and input validation.
```

## ⏱️ Response Timeline

We commit to the following response times:

| Severity | Initial Response | Status Update | Resolution Target |
|----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | 24 hours | Every 2 days | 7 days |
| **High** | 48 hours | Weekly | 30 days |
| **Medium** | 1 week | Bi-weekly | 60 days |
| **Low** | 2 weeks | Monthly | 90 days |

### Severity Classification

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass with admin access
- Data exfiltration of sensitive research data

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection with data access
- Cross-site scripting with session hijacking

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Local privilege escalation

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Low-impact information disclosure
- Minor security misconfigurations

## 🔄 Response Process

### 1. Initial Response (24-48 hours)
- Acknowledge receipt of the report
- Assign a unique tracking ID
- Initial severity assessment
- Request additional information if needed

### 2. Investigation (1-7 days)
- Technical analysis of the vulnerability
- Impact assessment
- Reproduction and validation
- Development of proof of concept (if safe)

### 3. Remediation (Varies by severity)
- Develop and test security patch
- Internal security review
- Coordination with security researchers
- Prepare security advisory

### 4. Disclosure
- Coordinate disclosure timeline
- Prepare public security advisory
- Release security patch
- Credit security researcher (if desired)

## 🏆 Security Researcher Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:

### Hall of Fame
Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in:
- Security advisory credits
- Project documentation
- Annual security report
- Conference presentations (with permission)

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines
- Allow reasonable time for patch development (typically 90 days)
- Do not access, modify, or delete data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Do not perform denial of service attacks
- Do not violate privacy or compromise user data
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
